About The Creator:
</h1>
<p>
Hello,my name is Cadence Currin I am 12 years old .I have a horse and a cat and a dog,and I love them
my horse's name is Selena and My dog's is Ella,my cat's name is Houdini.
I created this website because I love animals but the real reason to is because all animals deserve a Home
my cat Houdidni was at a shelter and some of my friends decided we should get barn cats so the got three 
Houdini became my cat because we fed him for thirty days.Houdini and the two other cats were put in the 
kill line but thankfully my friends found him before they would get put to sleep,and if it weren't 
for them Houdini and I would not have bonded the way we did.So in honor of all of the animals in the world
this website was created so they could all have a home and so people could find their Houdini to 
and have their Ella and Selena by their side.So that is why I created this so people can 
find the right pet for them and always have their pet by thier side(Enjoy).💖🐱🐶🐴
